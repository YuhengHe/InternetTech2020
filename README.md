# InternetTech2020
This is the project repo of Internet Technology Spring 2020 when I was doing exchange study at SDU (University of Southern Denmark).
## Project Description
Create a webpage that is similar to Instagram where user can create their own account and then upload their pictures. The user can add header to the pictures and also comments if they desire. 
We are ask to use the MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure to develop the website. We have attached a video demo to showcase our website functionalities (DEMO.MP4)
In this project, we have used PHP as our main programming language, as well as HTML, CSS,JavaScript, MySQL.

## Features
For the registration page, there are following features:
1. Check if it is a unique username.
2. Check if the email address is a valid one.
3. Check if the created password conforms to our specifications.
4. Check if repeated password is the same as the password, and show this with color (red means not the smae, and green means they match)
For the user feed page, there are folowing features:
1. User can upload their pictures
2. User can create captions for their pictures
3. User ca create description for their pictures.
4. When user logs out and logs in again, the data still persist.

Due to project time limitation, we did not spend much time making the page look good. However, we succeeded in implementing all features.
